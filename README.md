# 🥡🪶🤖 Folia To Go

## Guaranteed fresh! (Probably)
 
This repo has automated, nightly builds of the [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia) Minecraft server so that you don't have to build it yourself. 

Every midnight UTC, GitHub Actions runs [the build script](https://github.com/Slackadays/FoliaToGo/blob/main/.github/workflows/folia.yml) and uploads the server .jar to the [Actions](https://github.com/Slackadays/FoliaToGo/actions) area.

These builds may or may not be up-to-date with the latest Folia commits because they run at a certain time every day.

## Motivation

I made this because the [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) team refuses to provide automated builds until Folia is "ready." This was to prevent extra support requests. 

Unfortunately, this insane decision made life harder for those of us who want to use Folia anyway. So, why not just make a repo that does nothing but provide these pre-fab builds?

## Support

I don't have any affiliation with Paper or Folia other than being a happy user of theirs. Therefore, I can't provide Folia support here. Check out the [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) page if you need support, though!
